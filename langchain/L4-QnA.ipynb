Made right here in the USA, this rugged mat boasts a unique chevron weave design that not only adds style but also enhances its functionality.\\n\\nThe Waterhog dog mat is constructed using 24 oz of polyester fabric made from recycled materials - specifically, it's composed of 94% post-consumer plastic waste which helps reduce landfill contributions and ocean pollution while promoting a circular economy approach to product manufacturing.\\n\\nThe rugged mat features thick and thin fibers that work together effectively; the thicker ones scrape dirt off your pet's paws, whereas the finer strands absorb water quickly - this dual-purpose design ensures cleanliness while also keeping muddy footprints at bay.\\n\\nThe Waterhog dog mat is not only durable but it’s designed to withstand harsh conditions and heavy use without losing its shape or integrity, which makes it an ideal choice for outdoor activities as well as indoor usage in high-traffic areas like kitchens and living rooms where pets frequently roam.\\n\\nTo maintain the mat's longevity and appearance, regular vacuuming is recommended to remove dirt particles that may accumulate on its surface over time; however, it can also be hosed down if necessary for a deeper cleaning. The rubber backing of this dog mat provides additional grip against slippage when walking or running across various floor types - an essential feature ensuring safety and comfort during playtime with your furry friend.\\n\\nOne standout aspect about the Waterhog Dog Mat is its UPF 50+ rating, which means it offers top-tier sun protection for pets spending time outdoors in direct sunlight; this high level of UV resistance blocks up to 98% of harmful rays from penetrating through and reaching your pet's skin.\\n\\nThe mat comes with crossover no-slip straps that ensure a snug fit around the dog’s body, preventing any accidental slipping or movement during playtime - this feature adds an extra layer of security for both you and your beloved companion while providing peace of mind knowing they're safe on hard surfaces.\\n\\nIn summary, if you are looking to protect your floors from spills caused by pets without compromising style or comfort – the Ultradurable Recycled Waterhog Dog Mat is an excellent choice for both indoor and outdoor use that will keep muddy footprints at bay while promoting sustainability through its recycled material construction.\"}\n"
